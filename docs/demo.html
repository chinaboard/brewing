    <p style="padding-top: 23px; " class="monospace">I am a historian specializing in nuclear weapons. Today, I will be discussing the science behind Oppenheimer's work. In one particular scene, we witness the assembly of the gadget. This depiction is based on a few declassified and released pictures, as there are limited visual records of this level of assembly. All the available pictures are in black and white, although those who witnessed it described the color as a peach or tan shade.</p>





    <p style="padding-top: 23px; " class="monospace">The assembly involves placing several layers of high explosives, known as explosive lenses, around the plutonium sphere that serves as the power source for the device. This sphere is approximately the size of a grapefruit and made of solid metal. To provide a sense of scale, imagine a piece of steel being compressed symmetrically to half its size. The wedges seen in the scene are the detonators, which, when triggered simultaneously, initiate a shock wave through the device, causing it to implode.</p>





    <p style="padding-top: 23px; " class="monospace">Within the small sphere of plutonium lies an even tinier sphere made of polonium and beryllium. When compressed, this sphere releases neutrons, which are crucial for initiating the nuclear reaction. By compressing the entire assembly, an atomic bomb is detonated. This process is referred to as implosion.</p>





    <p style="padding-top: 23px; " class="monospace">Additionally, the movie depicts the final assembly of the gadget, which is based on actual footage from that time period. The lighting in the scene is reminiscent of historic footage available to us. The assembly takes place on a 100-foot tower, where the explosive sphere is brought to the test site and surrounded by a large tent. The aim is to maintain a highly controlled environment, minimizing any external interference that could disrupt the shock wave and potentially render the entire device ineffective. Even the presence of a small pebble could distort the shock wave enough to jeopardize the operation. Despite the challenging desert environment, the scientists strive to create an immaculate setting for the assembly process.</p>





    <p style="padding-top: 23px; " class="monospace">In the depicted scene, the tamper plug is inserted, intended to surround the plutonium core at the center of the bomb. This operation requires great care, as the tamper plug itself holds significant value, estimated at $400 million in 1945 currency.</p>





    <p style="padding-top: 23px; " class="monospace">(Note: Some technical terms have been explained for clarity, and minor changes have been made to improve the flow and coherence of the text.)</p>



    <p style="padding-top: 23px; " class="monospace">They don't want to mess this up because once you put the plutonium in there, every little step of getting it closer to being a bomb makes it a little bit more dangerous to be around and more radioactively problematic. This core is on the edge of being explosive. It's also radioactive and hot. Plutonium in that quantity is so radioactive that it's about 80 degrees Fahrenheit. They're dropping it through the center of the bomb. They've made a sort of trap door into the bomb so that the lens on top can come out. You can drop this thing in. In real life, they went to put it in and it didn't fit. Oh my God, have we totally messed this up? Wait a minute, wait a minute. It had to be the right temperature for it to fit. The outer part was cooler than the inner part, so they had to wait for them to reach the same temperature and then it just slid into place.</p>





    <p style="padding-top: 23px; " class="monospace">So there had to be one person left in the tower to set it all up at the very end, stay with the bomb, do the final connections, and then head back. And this was, of course, a very stressful job. They had previous mock-ups that were set off by lightning in the distance. So they were in a very precarious state here.</p>





    <p style="padding-top: 23px; " class="monospace">There's a scene before the actual Trinity test where General Groves is asking Oppenheimer about the possibility of this test destroying the world. There's a chance that when we push that button, we destroy the world. One of the real concerns was this problem of what they called atmospheric ignition. What if the nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere fuse together and release energy? Could they release enough energy that it would trigger more nuclear fusion that then engulfs the entire globe and leaves it a burnt, horrible cinder? Turns out that kind of equation is really hard to solve. But let's imagine that it's like 100 times easier than we think it is. We can make very conservative extrapolations and find that it's probably not going to happen. Chances are near zero.</p>





    <p style="padding-top: 23px; " class="monospace">Oppenheimer is giving the correct scientist's answer. They basically concluded it would be less than one in three million, something like that. In the 1970s, weapons scientists reevaluated those calculations. Could you set the earth on fire if you wanted to? Yes, but you would need bombs that would be hundreds of thousands of times more explosive.</p>



    <p style="padding-top: 23px; " class="monospace">than any bombs we ever made. And you'd need to have a much higher proportion of the ocean to be made out of a rare isotope called deuterium, a different type of hydrogen. If you had this, you could indeed turn the earth into a sun. The detonation took place very late at night. They wanted to see exactly how bright it was. And it's going to be harder to see that in the daytime when you're competing with the actual sun. They actually recommended that the bombs be dropped on Japan at night because they would be more psychologically stunning. But for logistical reasons, they were dropped in the morning on both of the cities. So those numbers you see are Nixie tubes. Those are a pre-digital way to display numbers. It's a very nice, period-appropriate touch. So at this point, the gadget, as they called it, is fully assembled. You can tell that because the wires are sticking out the top. On the front, that's called the X unit. That's the firing unit. It's assembled. To set off this kind of bomb, you have to send a high-voltage electrical signal to 32 separate places at exactly the same time. There are nanosecond tolerances on the timing to have it work right. And then they have a wire going all the way back to base camp and if you hit the big button on the wire, the detonator is charged. You're telling the bomb, go ahead and explode. It will. In the movie "Oppenheimer," the Trinity test is one of the climactic moments. It's ridiculously bright, much, much brighter than the actual sun. What Oppenheimer is putting on here are welding goggles, and these are so dark that you really can't see anything in them except something that is as bright as the sun. There were a few people at the Trinity test who looked at the explosion without anything over their eyes. One of them by accident, he dropped his goggles, and one of them on purpose. They both suffered from what was called flash blindness, temporary blindness. You'll see a big dark spot over your vision for quite some time. There were people who were relatively close to thousands of yards. Oppenheimer and the control bunker were much closer than many of the outlying ones. Most of the people there were instructed to lay down away from the blast so that they don't turn around and either get knocked over or get a face full of dust. So the Trinity test was heavily documented.</p>



    <p style="padding-top: 23px; " class="monospace">Both pressure gauges and cameras with telephoto lenses were used to document the Trinity test. Some shots were taken from a far distance, while others were captured from closer bunkers. Shots from the actual Trinity test resemble a wall of fire, especially in close-ups. Interestingly, in the earliest shots where they aimed to capture the initial moments of the fireball, the intense heat burned holes in the film. </p>





    <p style="padding-top: 23px; " class="monospace">One particular shot of interest is referred to as a "rope trick." These shots are only visible when captured at a high frame rate, around a thousand frames per second. In these shots, a tower with a bomb is seen with wires stabilizing it. A tendril of the fireball moves faster than the rest of the explosion because it burns through the wires as it travels downward. This phenomenon could not be seen by the observers at Trinity. </p>





    <p style="padding-top: 23px; " class="monospace">The shot illustrates the complex interaction that occurs when the blast wave hits the ground, rebounds upward, and intersects with the outwardly expanding blast wave. There is a significant difference in how the blast wave behaves depending on whether the bomb is detonated on the ground or slightly above it. A wider area of destruction is desired for the "mock stem" to maximize the blast pressure when detonating the bomb at a high altitude. The data obtained from the Trinity test will be used to determine the optimal altitude for dropping atomic bombs on Japan. </p>





    <p style="padding-top: 23px; " class="monospace">Prior to the Trinity test, the estimated yield of the bomb was around 4,000 tons of TNT equivalent. However, it ended up being much more powerful than anticipated, exceeding expectations by a factor of five. The Trinity test yielded an explosion equivalent to 20,000 tons of TNT. This destructive power is capable of obliterating a medium-sized city, such as Midtown Manhattan. Thus, the significance of the Trinity test goes beyond its success; it demonstrates the immense destructive potential of nuclear weapons. </p>





    <p style="padding-top: 23px; " class="monospace">The Manhattan Project, which oversaw the development of the atomic bomb, was a massive undertaking. It involved hundreds of thousands of people and accounted for approximately 1% of the civilian labor force. The total cost of the project was approximately $2 billion, which equated to about 1% of the total cost of World War II. The production of these weapons consumed 1% of the country's electricity supply. In just two and a half years, the project successfully established a new industry. The output of this industry was groundbreaking.</p>



    <p style="padding-top: 23px; " class="monospace">In the development of atomic bombs during World War II, there were significant efforts made to create three cores for the bombs. The first core was a plutonium one, weighing six kilograms or approximately 13 and a half pounds. This core was tested at Trinity. Additionally, there were about 64 kilograms or roughly 120 pounds of highly enriched uranium-235 used for the bomb that would eventually be dropped on Hiroshima. Another plutonium core was intended for use on Nagasaki but was never deployed due to the end of the war.</p>





    <p style="padding-top: 23px; " class="monospace">During this time, many individuals involved in the Manhattan Project considered it to be the best years of their lives, despite the guilt that some would later feel after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. One prominent figure in this project was J. Robert Oppenheimer, who had a complex persona. He expressed regret for the post-war proliferation of nuclear weapons and the subsequent development of even more powerful and destructive ones.</p>





    <p style="padding-top: 23px; " class="monospace">Oppenheimer foresaw the potential danger of a world where countries possessed thousands of times more powerful atomic bombs. He warned that a single night of warfare could annihilate 40 million Americans. He had concerns about the future of civilization and the adverse consequences such weaponry could have on the entire human race. It is this paradox that defines Oppenheimer - a person who sought peace, but utilized the means of war to achieve it.</p>
