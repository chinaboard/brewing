    <p class="monospace"><span>00:00:00</span><span class="indent"> I'm a historian of nuclear weapons.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:00:03</span><span class="indent"> And today I'm here to talk about</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:00:05</span><span class="indent"> the science behind Oppenheimer.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:00:11</span><span class="indent"> So that's a scene of them assembling the gadget.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:00:14</span><span class="indent"> This is clearly based on some pictures that have come out,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:00:17</span><span class="indent"> and there are not a ton of pictures</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:00:18</span><span class="indent"> showing this level of assembly</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:00:21</span><span class="indent"> that have been declassified and released.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:00:23</span><span class="indent"> All the pictures we have of this are black and white.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:00:25</span><span class="indent"> The people who actually saw it</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:00:28</span><span class="indent"> described it as being a sort of peach-colored,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:00:31</span><span class="indent"> a sort of tan-colored.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:00:32</span><span class="indent"> Each of those wedges are several layers of high explosive.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:00:37</span><span class="indent"> So there are sort of variants of TNT</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:00:39</span><span class="indent"> called explosive lenses,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:00:41</span><span class="indent"> and they are putting them around the plutonium sphere</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:00:44</span><span class="indent"> that powers the whole thing.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:00:45</span><span class="indent"> This is about the size of a grapefruit.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:00:49</span><span class="indent"> So plutonium's solid metal.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:00:51</span><span class="indent"> Imagine you had a piece of steel,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:00:52</span><span class="indent"> and I said, push it on all sides to make it smaller.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:00:55</span><span class="indent"> You need to shrink it by half its size</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:00:57</span><span class="indent"> exactly symmetrically.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:00:58</span><span class="indent"> Each of these are the detonators.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:00:59</span><span class="indent"> When they all go off,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:01:01</span><span class="indent"> they're gonna start a shock wave through this device.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:01:04</span><span class="indent"> It's gonna start going in, in, in.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:01:06</span><span class="indent"> Inside that little sphere of plutonium</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:01:09</span><span class="indent"> is even tinier sphere of polonium and beryllium.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:01:12</span><span class="indent"> This thing, if you compress it,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:01:13</span><span class="indent"> will shoot out some neutrons.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:01:15</span><span class="indent"> That's meant to just start the reaction.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:01:16</span><span class="indent"> You push the whole thing together</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:01:19</span><span class="indent"> and make an atomic bomb explode.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:01:20</span><span class="indent"> This is called implosion.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:01:22</span><span class="indent"> One of the things we see in the movie</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:01:25</span><span class="indent"> is the final assembly of the gadget.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:01:26</span><span class="indent"> This is based on actual footage</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:01:28</span><span class="indent"> that was taken at the time.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:01:30</span><span class="indent"> Even the lighting looks like</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:01:31</span><span class="indent"> in the historic footage that we have.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:01:33</span><span class="indent"> This is a 100-foot tower.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:01:35</span><span class="indent"> They've brought the explosive sphere</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:01:38</span><span class="indent"> out to the test site by the tower,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:01:40</span><span class="indent"> and they put a big tent around it.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:01:42</span><span class="indent"> You need this thing to be as controlled as possible.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:01:46</span><span class="indent"> If you got a pebble in there,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:01:48</span><span class="indent"> it could deform the shock wave by getting in.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:01:50</span><span class="indent"> It could deform the shock wave by just enough</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:01:53</span><span class="indent"> to make the whole thing either not work</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:01:55</span><span class="indent"> or not work very well.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:01:56</span><span class="indent"> So they want this to be a very pristine</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:01:59</span><span class="indent"> sort of environment, which is hard to do</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:02:01</span><span class="indent"> when you're in the middle of the desert.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:02:02</span><span class="indent"> They're putting in in this scene</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:02:04</span><span class="indent"> what's called the tamper plug.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:02:05</span><span class="indent"> The goal is to have this sit right around</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:02:08</span><span class="indent"> the plutonium core in the middle of the bomb.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:02:10</span><span class="indent"> This is a delicate operation.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:02:12</span><span class="indent"> This tamper plug arguably is worth</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:02:14</span><span class="indent"> $400 million in 1945 money.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:02:17</span><span class="indent"> They don't wanna mess this up</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:02:18</span><span class="indent"> because once you put the plutonium in there,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:02:19</span><span class="indent"> every little step of getting it closer to being a bomb</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:02:22</span><span class="indent"> makes it a little bit more dangerous to be around</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:02:24</span><span class="indent"> and more radioactively problematic.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:02:27</span><span class="indent"> This core is like on the edge of being explosive.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:02:30</span><span class="indent"> It's also radioactive.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:02:32</span><span class="indent"> It's also hot.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:02:33</span><span class="indent"> Plutonium in that quantity is so radioactive</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:02:35</span><span class="indent"> that it's about 80 degrees Fahrenheit.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:02:37</span><span class="indent"> They're dropping it through the center of the bomb.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:02:40</span><span class="indent"> They've made a sort of trap door basically into the bomb</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:02:43</span><span class="indent"> so that the lens on top can come out.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:02:45</span><span class="indent"> You can drop this thing in.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:02:47</span><span class="indent"> In real life, they went to put it in</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:02:50</span><span class="indent"> and it didn't fit.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:02:51</span><span class="indent"> Oh my God, have we totally messed this up?</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:02:52</span><span class="indent"> Wait a minute, wait a minute.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:02:54</span><span class="indent"> It had to be the right temperature for it to fit.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:02:57</span><span class="indent"> The outer part was cooler than the inner part was</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:03:00</span><span class="indent"> and so they had to wait for them</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:03:01</span><span class="indent"> to reach the same temperature</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:03:02</span><span class="indent"> and then it just slid into place.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:03:08</span><span class="indent"> So there had to be one person left in the tower</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:03:10</span><span class="indent"> to set it all up at the very end,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:03:12</span><span class="indent"> stay with the bomb, do the final connections,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:03:15</span><span class="indent"> and then head back.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:03:16</span><span class="indent"> And this was, of course, a very stressful job.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:03:18</span><span class="indent"> They had previous mock-ups that were set off</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:03:22</span><span class="indent"> by lightning in the distance.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:03:23</span><span class="indent"> So they were in a very precarious state here.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:03:29</span><span class="indent"> There's a scene before the actual Trinity test</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:03:31</span><span class="indent"> where General Groves is asking Oppenheimer</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:03:33</span><span class="indent"> about the possibility of this test destroying the world.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:03:37</span><span class="indent"> There's a chance that when we push that button,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:03:41</span><span class="indent"> we destroy the world.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:03:42</span><span class="indent"> One of the real concerns was this problem</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:03:44</span><span class="indent"> of what they called atmospheric ignition.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:03:46</span><span class="indent"> What if the nitrogen and oxygen in the atmosphere</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:03:50</span><span class="indent"> fuse together and release energy?</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:03:53</span><span class="indent"> Could they release enough energy</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:03:54</span><span class="indent"> that that would trigger more nuclear fusion</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:03:56</span><span class="indent"> that then goes over the entire globe</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:03:58</span><span class="indent"> and leaves it a burnt, horrible cinder?</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:04:00</span><span class="indent"> Turns out that kind of equation is really hard to do.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:04:03</span><span class="indent"> But let's imagine that it's like 100 times easier</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:04:05</span><span class="indent"> than we think it is.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:04:06</span><span class="indent"> We can sort of make very conservative extrapolations</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:04:09</span><span class="indent"> and we find it's probably not gonna happen.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:04:12</span><span class="indent"> Chances are near zero.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:04:13</span><span class="indent"> Near zero.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:04:14</span><span class="indent"> What do you want for the theory of lone?</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:04:16</span><span class="indent"> Oppenheimer is giving the correct scientist answer.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:04:18</span><span class="indent"> They basically concluded it would be less than</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:04:21</span><span class="indent"> one in three million, something like that.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:04:22</span><span class="indent"> In the 1970s, weapons scientists redid those calculations.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:04:26</span><span class="indent"> Could you set the earth on fire if you wanted to?</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:04:29</span><span class="indent"> Yes, but you need bombs that would be</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:04:31</span><span class="indent"> hundreds of thousands of times more explosive</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:04:33</span><span class="indent"> than any bombs we ever made.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:04:35</span><span class="indent"> And you'd need to have much higher proportion</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:04:38</span><span class="indent"> of the ocean be made out of a rare isotope</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:04:40</span><span class="indent"> called deuterium, a different type of hydrogen.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:04:42</span><span class="indent"> If you had this, you could indeed</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:04:44</span><span class="indent"> turn the earth into a sun.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:04:49</span><span class="indent"> The detonation took place very late at night.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:04:51</span><span class="indent"> They wanted to see exactly how bright it was.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:04:54</span><span class="indent"> And it's gonna be harder to see that in the daytime</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:04:56</span><span class="indent"> when you're competing with the actual sun.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:04:58</span><span class="indent"> They actually had recommended that the bombs</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:05:01</span><span class="indent"> be dropped on Japan at night</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:05:03</span><span class="indent"> because they would be more psychologically stunning.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:05:05</span><span class="indent"> But for logistical reasons,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:05:07</span><span class="indent"> they were dropped in the morning on both of the cities.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:05:12</span><span class="indent"> So those numbers you see are Nixie tubes.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:05:14</span><span class="indent"> Those are a pre-digital way to display numbers.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:05:17</span><span class="indent"> It's a very nice period appropriate touch.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:05:20</span><span class="indent"> So at this point, the gadget, as they called it,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:05:22</span><span class="indent"> is fully assembled.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:05:23</span><span class="indent"> You can tell that because the wires</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:05:25</span><span class="indent"> are sticking out the top.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:05:26</span><span class="indent"> On the front, that's called the X unit.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:05:27</span><span class="indent"> That's the firing unit.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:05:28</span><span class="indent"> It's assembled.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:05:29</span><span class="indent"> To set off this kind of bomb,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:05:31</span><span class="indent"> you have to send a high voltage electrical signal</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:05:34</span><span class="indent"> to 32 separate places at exactly the same time.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:05:37</span><span class="indent"> Nanosecond tolerances on the timing to have it work right.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:05:40</span><span class="indent"> And then they have a wire going all the way back to base camp</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:05:42</span><span class="indent"> and if you hit the big button on the wire.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:05:44</span><span class="indent"> Detonator's charged.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:05:46</span><span class="indent"> You're telling the bomb, go ahead and explode.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:05:48</span><span class="indent"> It will.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:05:56</span><span class="indent"> In the movie Oppenheimer,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:05:58</span><span class="indent"> the Trinity test is one of the climax moments.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:06:02</span><span class="indent"> It's ridiculously bright,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:06:03</span><span class="indent"> much, much brighter than the actual sun.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:06:05</span><span class="indent"> What Oppenheimer's putting on here are welding goggles</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:06:08</span><span class="indent"> and these are so dark</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:06:09</span><span class="indent"> that you really can't see anything in them</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:06:11</span><span class="indent"> except something that is as bright as the sun.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:06:14</span><span class="indent"> There were a few people at the Trinity test</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:06:16</span><span class="indent"> who looked at the explosion without anything</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:06:19</span><span class="indent"> over their eyes.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:06:20</span><span class="indent"> One of them by accident, he dropped his goggles</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:06:22</span><span class="indent"> and one of them on purpose.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:06:23</span><span class="indent"> They both suffered from what was called flash blindness,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:06:25</span><span class="indent"> temporary blindness.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:06:27</span><span class="indent"> You'll see a big dark spot over your vision</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:06:29</span><span class="indent"> for quite some time.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:06:31</span><span class="indent"> There were people who were relatively close</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:06:32</span><span class="indent"> to thousands of yards.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:06:34</span><span class="indent"> Oppenheimer and the sort of control bunker,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:06:36</span><span class="indent"> much closer than a lot of the outlying ones.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:06:38</span><span class="indent"> Most of the people there were instructed</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:06:40</span><span class="indent"> to lay down away from the blast</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:06:43</span><span class="indent"> so that they don't turn around</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:06:44</span><span class="indent"> and either get knocked over or get a face full of dust.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:06:50</span><span class="indent"> So the Trinity test was heavily, heavily documented</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:06:54</span><span class="indent"> both by pressure gauges and cameras</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:06:56</span><span class="indent"> with telephoto lenses from a very far distance,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:06:58</span><span class="indent"> but some of them were closer in bunkers.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:07:01</span><span class="indent"> Anytime you see a closeup</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:07:02</span><span class="indent"> and it's sort of like a wall of fire,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:07:03</span><span class="indent"> there are shots from the actual Trinity test</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:07:05</span><span class="indent"> that look pretty similar to that.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:07:07</span><span class="indent"> Interestingly, on some of the very earliest shots</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:07:09</span><span class="indent"> where they were trying to get</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:07:10</span><span class="indent"> the very first moments of the fireball,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:07:12</span><span class="indent"> it was hot enough that it burned holes in the film.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:07:15</span><span class="indent"> This particular shot is interesting</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:07:17</span><span class="indent"> because this is what they call in the business a rope trick.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:07:21</span><span class="indent"> And they only show up when you can take pictures</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:07:23</span><span class="indent"> that are a thousand frames per second</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:07:25</span><span class="indent"> or something like this.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:07:26</span><span class="indent"> You have a tower with a bomb on it</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:07:28</span><span class="indent"> and it's got wires stabilizing the tower.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:07:31</span><span class="indent"> And there's a little tendril of the fireball</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:07:33</span><span class="indent"> that's going faster than the rest</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:07:35</span><span class="indent"> because it's blowing up the wire as it goes down there.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:07:38</span><span class="indent"> No one at Trinity could have actually seen this.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:07:41</span><span class="indent"> What you're seeing here is the complex interaction</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:07:44</span><span class="indent"> that happens when the blast wave hits the ground,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:07:47</span><span class="indent"> goes straight down, bounces back up,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:07:49</span><span class="indent"> and then intersects with that blast wave coming out.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:07:52</span><span class="indent"> There's a really big difference</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:07:54</span><span class="indent"> in how the blast wave behaves</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:07:55</span><span class="indent"> from a bomb that's right on the ground</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:07:57</span><span class="indent"> from one that's a little bit in the air.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:07:59</span><span class="indent"> They want this, what's called the mock stem,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:08:02</span><span class="indent"> to have a wider area of destruction.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:08:05</span><span class="indent"> That's how you maximize the blast pressure</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:08:07</span><span class="indent"> of detonating it very high above the ground.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:08:09</span><span class="indent"> They're gonna use that data to set the altitude</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:08:12</span><span class="indent"> of the atomic bomb over Japan.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:08:14</span><span class="indent"> When they went into the Trinity test,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:08:15</span><span class="indent"> their sort of best guess was it would maybe be</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:08:18</span><span class="indent"> 4,000 tons of TNT.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:08:20</span><span class="indent"> It ended up being more powerful than they thought</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:08:22</span><span class="indent"> by a factor of like five, 20,000 tons of TNT equivalent.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:08:26</span><span class="indent"> This is enough to destroy a sort of medium-sized city.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:08:30</span><span class="indent"> If you're a much bigger city, like say New York City,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:08:33</span><span class="indent"> it's enough to destroy like Midtown.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:08:35</span><span class="indent"> So this is one of the reasons why Trinity is so important.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:08:38</span><span class="indent"> It's not just it works.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:08:39</span><span class="indent"> They find out it works really well.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:08:45</span><span class="indent"> So the Manhattan Project is this gigantic endeavor.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:08:47</span><span class="indent"> It's this massive industrial project.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:08:49</span><span class="indent"> It employs like 500,000 people.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:08:53</span><span class="indent"> It's like 1% of the civilian labor force.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:08:54</span><span class="indent"> And it costs like $2 billion in their money,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:08:56</span><span class="indent"> which is like 1% of the whole cost of World War II.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:08:59</span><span class="indent"> They use 1% of all the electricity in the country</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:09:01</span><span class="indent"> to make these weapons.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:09:03</span><span class="indent"> They're building an industry in like two and a half years.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:09:06</span><span class="indent"> And the output of that industry</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:09:07</span><span class="indent"> is a very tiny amount of material,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:09:09</span><span class="indent"> a six kilogram plutonium core, 13 and a half pounds.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:09:13</span><span class="indent"> That's the one they first test at Trinity.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:09:15</span><span class="indent"> About 64 kilograms, so about 120 something pounds</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:09:19</span><span class="indent"> of highly enriched uranium, uranium-235.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:09:21</span><span class="indent"> That's for the bomb that's gonna be dropped on Hiroshima.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:09:23</span><span class="indent"> And then they have one more plutonium core.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:09:26</span><span class="indent"> That's the one they're gonna end up dropping on Nagasaki.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:09:28</span><span class="indent"> So all of that effort is to make</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:09:30</span><span class="indent"> these three cores for the bombs.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:09:32</span><span class="indent"> And they had one more bomb in the pipeline.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:09:34</span><span class="indent"> They ended up never sending it.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:09:36</span><span class="indent"> The war ended.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:09:37</span><span class="indent"> Many of these people talked about this</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:09:39</span><span class="indent"> as the best years of their life in some ways.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:09:41</span><span class="indent"> They had a lot of fun.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:09:42</span><span class="indent"> And some of them felt quite guilty about that</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:09:44</span><span class="indent"> after Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:09:49</span><span class="indent"> Oppenheimer's a really complicated character.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:09:52</span><span class="indent"> What he said he regretted was that after World War II,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:09:56</span><span class="indent"> they continued to make more weapons.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:09:57</span><span class="indent"> And they continued to make bigger weapons.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:09:59</span><span class="indent"> And they continued to make the kind of world</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:10:01</span><span class="indent"> that he thought would ultimately put civilization itself</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:10:04</span><span class="indent"> in danger.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:10:05</span><span class="indent"> In the years to come, it will be possible</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:10:07</span><span class="indent"> to kill 40 million American people</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:10:10</span><span class="indent"> by the use of atomic bombs in a single night.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:10:13</span><span class="indent"> He knew in 1945 that there were ideas on the table</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:10:17</span><span class="indent"> for bombs that would be thousands of times more powerful.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:10:19</span><span class="indent"> And that the nations of the world</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:10:21</span><span class="indent"> could all get them if they wanted them.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:10:23</span><span class="indent"> And that a war with bombs of that big</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:10:25</span><span class="indent"> could be fatal for the entire species.</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:10:27</span><span class="indent"> And so that's the sort of paradox of Oppenheimer,</span></p>

    <p class="monospace"><span>00:10:29</span><span class="indent"> this person who wants peace, but he does it through war.</span></p>
